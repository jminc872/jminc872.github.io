<h1>Jake Mincy</h1>

<h3>Sophomore in Greenville, SC</h3>

<p> My name Jakeb Chandler Mincy, and I'm a sophomore Information Technology major
 at <a href=http://www.bju.edu/>Bob Jones University</a> of Greenville, South Carolina. 
I've worked at four different jobs since I was 16. The first three of these jobs were located in Morton, IL. 
My first job involved working as an assistant councillor at a daycamp called 
<a href=https://www.cocusa.org/>Camp of Champions USA</a>, where I was responsible
 for supervising groups of ten to fifteen campers. The following summer, I mowed lawns for a company called The Yard Commander, LLC, while 
simultaneously working at a sandwhich shop by the name of <a href=https://www.greatharvest.com/>Great 
Harvest Bread Co.</a>. While at college, I have worked one job, which involved cleaning 
various office buildings thorughout the Greenville area.</p>

<p>I enjoy playing soccer, reading, and writing. My favorite book is "Empires of 
the Sea", by Roger Crowely. I've lived in five different states: South Carolina, 
New York, California, Michigan, and Illinois. New York City is, by far, the best place I've lived. I go to Palmetto Baptist Church, and help out with setting up the audio-visual equipment.</p>
