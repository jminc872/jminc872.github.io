<h1>Jake Mincy</h1>
<h3>Sophomore in Greenville, SC</h3>

<p>My name is Jakeb Mincy, and I'm a sophomore Information Technology major at <a href=http://www.bju.edu/>Bob Jones University</a> of Greenville, South Carolina. I've worked at four different jobs since I was 16. The first three of these jobs were located in Morton, IL. My first job involved working as an assistant councillor at a daycamp called <a href=https://www.cocusa.org/>Camp of Champions USA</a>, where I was responsible for supervising groups of ten to fifteen campers. The following summer, I mowed lawns for a company called The Yard Commander, LLC, while simultaneously working at a sandwhich shop by the name of <a href=https://www.greatharvest.com/>Great Harvest Bread Company</a>. While at college, I have worked one job, which involved cleaning various office buildings thorughout the Greenville area.</p>
<p>I go to Palmetto Baptist Church, and help out with setting up the audio-visual equipment. I also offer rides to people who don't have cars.</p>
<p>I've lived in five different states: South Carolina, New York, California, Michigan, and Illinois. New York City is, by far, the best place that I've lived. I love spending time in cities (particularly New York City). I also enjoy playing soccer, reading, and writing.</p>
